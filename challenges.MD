- Note: nothing will render to the page yet.

/\*\* main.jsx

- Challenge 2:
- 1.  Create an "About" component (just render another h1 that says
- "About page" or something more interesting of your choosing).
- 2.  Create a new Route to render the About component when the path
- is /about

- Challenge 3:
- Bootstrap the VanLife project by creating the first 2 routes:
- Home and About.
-
- Also include the navbar that can link between the two routes.
- For now, you'll either need to copy/paste the navbar code
- to both Home and About pages, or you'll need to find a place
- to put it where it can be shared between the two pages.
- (Don't overthink this part - just do whatever is easiest for
- you because we'll learn a better approach very soon)
-
- Review challenge: do all the CSS yourself based on the design
- linked in the slides.
